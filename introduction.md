Hi, I’m Sherratt Pemberton

Industries today are built around software. From acting as a system interface to storing and accessing data, 
and automating tasks and processes to increase accuracy and save time and money. When software stops working it can cause loss of data, 
grind businesses to a halt and put lives at risk.

My goal is to help engineer and build high quality, robust, reliable, maintainable and user-friendly software solutions. 
That both save businesses time and money and allow systems to operate reliably and safely. 

I am not particuarly focused on specific tech stack at this point but am looking to build a strong engineering and design foundation. 
I'm allways looking for oppertunitys to grow my skills and become a more effective developer.

I'm particuarly interested in learning to work on control and operating systems.

The best way to contact me is email. My email is Sherratt285@gmail.com.
